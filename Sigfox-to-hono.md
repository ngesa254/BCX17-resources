# Sigfox Adapter for HonoThis adapter exposes an endpoint which can be called by the Sigfox adapter. In Sigfox nomenclature, this refers to the Callback endpoint.The url of the adapter is http://hono.bosch-iot-suite.com:10050## Exposed Endpoints* Uplink: POST `http://hono.bosch-iot-suite.com:10050/telemetry/bcx/deviceid`
* Adapter Status: POST `http://hono.bosch-iot-suite.com:10050/status`* Last Known Error: GET `http://hono.bosch-iot-suite.com:10050/status/err`
* Last Device Call: GET `http://hono.bosch-iot-suite.com:10050/status/bcx/deviceId`
* Downlink: GET  `http://hono.bosch-iot-suite.com:10050/dl/bcx/[deviceId]`

## Setting Up Pre-requisites1. You'll need to register your device id on hono via Hono's registration endpoint### Configuring the Sigfox Backend1. From the Sigfox backend, you'll need to create a Callback for your device and configure with the following parameters (New > Custom Callback)2. Type "Data - Uplink"3. Channel as "URL"4. Send Duplicate - Unchecked5. URL Pattern: `http://hono.bosch-iot-suite.com:10050/telemetry/bcx/{device}`6. HTTP Method: `POST`7. Content-Type: `application/json`8. Body: 
9. ```
{"time" : "{time}","device" : "{device}", 
"duplicate" : "{duplicate}", 
"snr" : "{snr}", 
"avgSnr" : "{avgSnr}", 
"rssi" : "{rssi}","station" : "{station}",   
 "lat" : "{lat}","lng" : "{lng}","seqNumber” : "{seqNumber}",
"data" : "{data}"}
```
## Usage 
### UplinkIf you have configured your device's Callback on the Sigfox Backend, the call to the adapter should automatically be made and you need not do anything further.
You can then just subscribe to any notifications to your device via Hono.
### DownlinkSince Hono doesn't support downstream as yet, you can make downstream requests directly to the adapter.
To make a downlink call to your Sigfox device, call the `/dl/bcx/[deviceid]` endpoint with a POST request. The body of the request should be the data you wish to send downstream.
The next time the Sigfox device calls with an "ack" request, the data intended for downstream will be pushed down during the response. (`HTTP 200`).

A HTTP code of 204 is returned if there's no downlink data for your device.  ### Debugging and Errors

#### Last Device StatusIn order to debug/observe the last call made by your device to the adapter, you can call the following endpoint: `/status/bcx/[deviceid]`
The endpoint will return the last packet frame sent by your device to the adapter via the Sigfox Backend.
#### Other Debugging/Status Endpoints* `/status` - General status and uptime information
* `/status/err - Last reported/known error/exception encountered by the adapter 
## Payload Format A typical incoming Sigfox payload would look something like this: ```
 {     "time" : "1480717528",     "device" : "sigfox-device-1",     "duplicate" : "false",     "snr" : "18.53"",     "avgSnr" : "32.50",     "rssi" : "-123.00",     "station" : "0DF1",     "lat" : "49.0",     "lng" : "3.0",     "seqNumber” : "31",     "data" : "1234"}
```## Limitations 

### Downlink* Hono only currently supports telemetry and events. Command and Control (i.e. downlink) is not supported. As such, to perform downlink operations, you'll need to call the adapter's downlink endpoint manually. See Usage.* Downlink messages are also limited to 8 bytes. This is a Sigfox limitation.* Calls to the downlink endpoints do not currently check if a device is registered on Hono
